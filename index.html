                  Hi, my name is Richard. Please don't mind the picture to the left where it looks like I'm
                  trying to "sell you real estate" as my friends put it. Aside from my desire for a new headshot,
                  I have a burning desire to better myself in all ways that I can. When one grows as a person, the 
                  more one can contribute to the world and others.
                <br>
                  Taking this desire and forming it into action has manifested this portfolio that you see today. It may not
                  be much now, but this marks the beginning of my journey into web development! Through this journey, my resolution
                  is to maintain discipline in staying driven in both my professional and personal life.
                <br>  
                  (As you can tell, writing about me's are not my thing so yeah... my tinder game is WEAK. There a boot camp for that?)
